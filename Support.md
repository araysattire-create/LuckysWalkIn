# How to Invest in Second Chances

Lucky’s Walk-In runs on the generosity of the community. When you donate, you aren't just giving away "old clothes"—you are providing the uniform for someone’s first day of a new life.

### 👔 Items We Need (Professional & Clean)
We accept new or gently used professional attire:
* **Suits:** Men’s and Women’s (all sizes)
* **Shirts:** Button-downs, blouses, and professional polos
* **Footwear:** Dress shoes, loafers, and clean flats
* **Accessories:** Ties, belts, and professional bags/briefcases
* **Basics:** New socks and undershirts

### 🧼 Hygiene & Prep
To ensure our clients feel their best, we also accept:
* Unopened travel-size toiletries (deodorant, shaving kits, etc.)
* Gift cards for local dry cleaners (to help us keep the suits sharp)

### 📍 How to Donate
[Insert your drop-off location or "Email us to schedule a pickup" here]
